- Need useful errors in `decode` whenever parsing fails.
For example in some nested record's fields could not be matched against a specified set of atoms the appropriate place and error should be emmited instead of silently skipping the outer structure.

- Allow `[#rec{}]` spec in `?gen_decode`
- Catch recursive (loops) type definitions and report error instead of hanging compilation
- `undefined` specified as a type for a field leads to hanging of the compilation
